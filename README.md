An archaeology script for RedM

This is the free version of my archaeology RedM script.

It will spawn mounds of dirt in pre-configured places, and allow players to walk up to them and dig.
Once a player digs the mound, it will changed to an open mound with an item (configurable) spawned inside it.

That item can be picked up and the corresponding item will be placed in the users' inventory.

Pretty straightforward. Config is documented for your ease.

Don't forget to add the items you configure as rewards to the DB!
The insert.sql will cover the initial item reward for the default spots, and the accompanying image can be put in your vorp_inv image folder.
